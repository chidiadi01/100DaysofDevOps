Revert changes in git. I navigated to the folder and did the following.

✅ `git log` to see the recent commits

✅ I copied the commit hash of the initial commit which I was to reset to, and did `git reset --hard <commit-hash>`

✅ I staged my changes with `git add .`

✅ I commited the changes and pushed to origin.
