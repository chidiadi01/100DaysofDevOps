100 Days of Devops 🚀 

Create a Git branch, copy a folder into it, commit and merge into the master branch.

Git merge is used to combine changes from one branch into another. After finishing work in a feature branch, you switch to the target branch (in this case, master) and run `git merge source-branch`. This brings in the commits, keeping history intact.
